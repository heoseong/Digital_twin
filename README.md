<b> Overview </b></br>
The data acquisition, integration, and analysis process was carried out in the order of the folders. Each folder contains R code along with the raw data. After performing steps 01 to 09, I merged or processed the collected data and organized it in the 09 folder. Then, the figures included in the paper were constructed according to the figure order. Each figure folder also contains R code along with the data used. The shp files used to create the map were downloaded from NSDIP.


<b> Hardware Requirements </b></br>
The author's computer hardware specifications are as follows and were fully functional for the analysis: a Core i5 (the 10th Generation) and 16 GB memory.


<b> Software Requirements </b></br>
To run the code, you need to have v4.3.0 or later of the R program installed. To install packages in R, use the install.packages() command. For example, to install the 'tidyverse' package, run install.packages("tidyverse")
